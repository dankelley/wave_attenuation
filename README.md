# wave_attenuation

An R shiny app to display the depth attenuation of the pressure signal that
results from surface gravity waves. Infinitesimal wave dynamics are used in the
calculation. For more, run the app (e.g. in RStudio, load wave_attenuation.R in
the editor and then click the "Run" button).
